# Code Smell Detection System

## Overview

The MDXViewer project implements a comprehensive code smell detection system that makes code quality issues immediately obvious to developers. This system uses multiple layers of detection and visualization to ensure high code quality standards.

## 🎯 What Are Code Smells?

Code smells are indicators of potential problems in code that, while not technically errors, suggest areas where the code could be improved for better maintainability, readability, and performance.

### Categories of Code Smells We Detect

1. **🔴 Complexity Issues**
    - Functions with high cyclomatic complexity
    - Deeply nested code structures
    - Functions with too many parameters

2. **📏 Length Issues**
    - Large files (> 500 lines)
    - Long functions (> 50 lines)
    - Long lines (> 120 characters)

3. **🔧 Maintainability Issues**
    - Unused variables and imports
    - Magic numbers without explanation
    - Dead/unreachable code

4. **🎨 Style Issues**
    - Inconsistent formatting
    - Variable naming issues
    - Improper indentation

5. **💙 TypeScript Issues**
    - Use of `any` type
    - Missing type annotations
    - Non-optimal type usage

6. **⚛️ React Issues**
    - Missing hook dependencies
    - Improper component patterns
    - Performance anti-patterns

## 🛠️ Detection Tools

### 1. Enhanced ESLint Configuration

Our ESLint setup includes strict rules for detecting code smells:

```javascript
// Key rules for code smell detection
{
    "complexity": ["error", { "max": 10 }],
    "max-lines-per-function": ["error", { "max": 50 }],
    "max-lines": ["error", { "max": 500 }],
    "max-params": ["error", { "max": 4 }],
    "max-depth": ["error", { "max": 4 }],
    "@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any": "error"
}
```

### 2. Custom Visual Formatter

We use a custom ESLint formatter (`scripts/eslint-formatter-code-smells.ts`) that:

- **Color-codes** different types of issues
- **Categorizes** problems with emojis
- **Prioritizes** issues by severity
- **Shows** auto-fixable vs manual-fix-required issues
- **Provides** actionable recommendations

### 3. Interactive HTML Reports

The code smell detector (`scripts/code-smell-detector.ts`) generates:

- **Visual charts** showing issue distribution
- **Detailed tables** with file locations and descriptions
- **Priority recommendations** based on issue patterns
- **Trend analysis** over time

### 4. VS Code Integration

Enhanced editor experience with:

- **Real-time highlighting** of code smells
- **Problem panel integration** with color coding
- **Recommended extensions** for better visibility
- **Automatic formatting** on save

## 🚀 Usage

### Command Line Tools

```bash
# Run code smell analysis with visual output
npm run lint:smells

# Generate detailed HTML report
npm run code-smell-report

# Complete quality check
npm run quality-check

# Fix auto-fixable issues
npm run lint:fix
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### ESLint Rules Customization

To adjust code smell detection rules, edit `eslint.config.js`:

```javascript
// Example: Increase complexity threshold for specific files
{
    files: ["src/legacy/**/*.ts"],
    rules: {
        "complexity": ["warn", { "max": 15 }]
    }
}
```

### VS Code Settings

Customize editor behavior in `.vscode/settings.json`:

```json
{
    "eslint.alwaysShowStatus": true,
    "problems.decorations.enabled": true,
    "editor.rulers": [80, 120]
}
```

## 🎯 Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Run checks frequently**: Use `npm run lint:smells` during development
2. **Fix issues incrementally**: Don't let code smells accumulate
3. **Understand the why**: Learn why certain patterns are considered smells
4. **Use auto-fix**: Let tools fix simple issues automatically

### For Teams

1. **Set up pre-commit hooks**: Prevent smelly code from entering the repository
2. **Review reports regularly**: Use HTML reports in code reviews
3. **Establish thresholds**: Define acceptable levels for different projects
4. **Educate team members**: Share knowledge about code quality practices

## 🚀 Advanced Features

### SonarQube Integration

For enterprise-level code analysis:

```bash
# Install SonarQube scanner
npm install -g sonarqube-scanner

# Run analysis
sonar-scanner
```

### Custom Rules

Create project-specific rules in `eslint.config.js`:

```javascript
// Custom rule for project naming conventions
{
    "naming-convention": ["error", {
        "selector": "interface",
        "format": ["PascalCase"],
        "prefix": ["I"]
    }]
}
```

## 📈 Metrics and KPIs

Track code quality with these metrics:

- **Code Smell Density**: Issues per 1000 lines
- **Technical Debt Ratio**: Time to fix vs time to develop
- **Quality Gate**: Pass/fail threshold for builds
- **Trend Analysis**: Quality improvement over time

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Too many false positives**: Adjust rule thresholds
2. **Performance impact**: Use incremental analysis
3. **Team resistance**: Provide education and gradual adoption
4. **Rule conflicts**: Review and harmonize ESLint configuration
