# MDX Viewer UI Refactoring - Complete ✅

## Summary

Successfully completed comprehensive UI refactoring of the MDX Viewer application with improved UX, better code organization, and enhanced search functionality.

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. Sidebar Navigation Improvements

-   **Single Folder Expansion**: Only one sidebar folder is expanded at a time - specifically the one containing the currently active/open file
-   **Auto-Collapse**: Other folders automatically collapse when a new one is expanded
-   **Active File Highlighting**: The currently open file is visually highlighted in the sidebar

### 2. Navigation Restructure

-   **Moved to Topbar**: Navigation links moved from sidebar to the center of the topbar
-   **Responsive Design**: Navigation adapts properly to different screen sizes
-   **Clean Sidebar**: Removed navigation clutter from the sidebar for better file focus

### 3. File Organization

-   **CSS Files**: Moved all .css files to `src/assets/styles/` directory
-   **Updated Imports**: All CSS imports in `main.tsx` and `App.tsx` properly updated
-   **Constants**: Moved `navigationItems` to `src/const/navigation.ts` with barrel export

### 4. Enhanced Search Functionality

-   **Real-time Search**: Search input moved to sidebar above File Explorer
-   **Live Filtering**: File tree filters in real-time as user types
-   **Visual Feedback**:
    -   Search terms highlighted in results
    -   "Searching..." indicator while typing (with 300ms debounce)
    -   Results count display
    -   "No results" state with helpful messaging
-   **Smooth UX**: Animations and transitions for better user experience

### 5. Component Architecture

-   **Modular Design**: Refactored Sidebar into smaller, focused components:
    -   `SearchInput.tsx` - Dedicated search input with states
    -   `FileTreeNode.tsx` - Individual file/folder tree nodes
    -   `NoResults.tsx` - Empty state display
-   **Custom Hook**: `useFileSearch.ts` for search logic separation
-   **Clean Code**: Removed duplicate imports and unused code

## 📁 New File Structure

## 🎯 Key Improvements

### User Experience

-   **Debounced Typing**: Prevents excessive re-renders
-   **Efficient Updates**: Only re-renders affected components

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Search Implementation

-   **Synchronous Filtering**: Immediate results without API calls
-   **Recursive Tree Search**: Searches through nested folder structures
-   **Highlight Matching**: Visual emphasis on search terms
-   **Debounced Typing State**: 300ms delay for "Searching..." indicator

### State Management

-   **Local State**: Component-level state for UI interactions
-   **Custom Hooks**: Reusable logic extraction
-   **Proper Cleanup**: Memory leak prevention with useEffect cleanup

### Responsive Design
